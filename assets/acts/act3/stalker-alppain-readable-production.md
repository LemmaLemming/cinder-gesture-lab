# Sunbound Stalker — stronger front Alppain fork candidate

Generated 8 October 2026 with the built-in `image_gen` tool, `precise-object-edit`, two local `referenced_image_paths`, and `transparent_background: true`. One edit and one retained native still. The PNG is copied byte-for-byte from the generated output; no raster edits, alpha rewriting, cropping, resizing, CLI fallback or atlas fabrication.

- Common family scale stays `1.35/807 = 0.0016728624535315986` world units per native pixel. The candidate's 806-pixel visible height would be about `1.348327` world units at that scale. Do not renormalize its height or modify collision to fit the cutout.
- Coverage: one front, three-quarter lower-right-facing braced preparation still. No additional recovery, active-lunge, hurt, defeat or opposite-facing sequence is supplied by this file.
- Collision/occlusion role: decorative whole-body cutout only; no collider, damage region, contact disk, warning footprint or geometry. The visual contour cannot extend the authoritative source capsule or recovery hitbox.
- Generation-time readiness: native inspection only for this new candidate. It is neither imported nor selected by a scene/script consumer. Actual portrait comparison, moving contact, state/facing coverage and crest teaching acceptance remain pending.

## Source and requested edit

The [Act 3 concept](../../../docs/ACT3_CONCEPT.md#three-regular-enemy-roles) calls for two Stalker crest silhouettes identifying the sun state and easier flank; it does not prescribe these exact contours or a left/right mapping. [C50's entity record](../../../docs/reference-library/act3/research/entities.json) identifies the creature as an invented game proposal, with ordinary slash recovery in both suns and no sun-dependent recovery hitbox. Root's short fork contour choice is original game art, not novel canon, a new enemy, organ, ability, exclusive weak point or cue.

Selected vocabulary remains [G12's regular-threat board](../../../docs/concept-art/act3/bosses/03-candidates-and-threats.png) and [G18's Twin Suns gameplay board](../../../docs/concept-art/act3/gameplay/01-twin-suns-gameplay.png), preserved through the original Branchspell source: violet glassy angular living plates, compact low body, four limbs, directional lowered head and restrained ivory/lime low seam. The G18 line denotes the written lunge lane, not a laser. [Art README](../../../docs/concept-art/act3/README.md) and [adaptation boundaries](../../../docs/concept-art/act3/ADAPTATION_NOTES.md) remain applicable.

Actually opened both native input PNGs before the edit and the returned native PNG afterward. Branchspell was the exact body target; existing Alppain supported only the fork configuration. The prior front Alppain's small notch and upper-back shortening motivated this one stronger candidate. The prompt asked for a substantial short two-prong open V/U with approximately 100–125 native pixels of gap, while preserving Branchspell anatomy, placement, baseline and palette.

## Native observations and request shortfall

The output visibly retains the same organism family, all four bent limbs and clawed feet, separated limb gaps, pale low flank join, braced stance and lower-right head direction. The broad violet head fork has a deeper open notch and substantial flat prongs. The original tall dorsal/back silhouette is retained much more closely than the previous Alppain edit: the alpha-128 visible top is y245 versus Branchspell y244, instead of the older Alppain's y282. Lowest visible feet remain y1051. Width remains 1013 pixels, with the overall left/right bounds shifted one native pixel right.

The requested 100–125-pixel open gap was **not achieved**. Read-only alpha inspection in head-crest ROI `[790,470,1031,631]` found the largest horizontally bounded alpha<128 row gap to be **58 pixels**, from x872 to x930 at y566. Sampled rows y480–600 show gaps of 31–52 pixels; the old Alppain reference had gaps of 16–38 pixels at sampled rows y465–510. These measurements describe the generated cutout's horizontal opening, not perceived screen-space readability.

At a hypothetical whole-creature height of 50–60 pixels, simple uniform scale would make the widest measured opening approximately 3.6–4.3 pixels, below the requested roughly 6–8. This is an arithmetic estimate, not an actual camera/GPU measurement. The deeper notch could help recognition, but native inspection does not demonstrate that it will remain distinct beside the existing Branchspell crest in the real portrait. Retain as a candidate with this explicit shortfall; no second generation was performed.

The edit also redraws facet pixels, the head-crest junction and some fine body/foot edges. Global bounds and recognizable anatomy remain close, but pixels outside the crest are not invariant. Do not describe it as an exact crest-only patch or registered animation frame. No corrective image processing was applied.

## Owner comparison and state limits

Root must compare the new cutout at the same family pixel scale and provisional pivot beside the actual [shared Act 3 traveller](../../characters/presentations/manifest.json), under both current sun presentations. Compare the fork as a broad silhouette in muted/grayscale contrast, its head-to-lane direction, four-limb gaps, feet contact and the tiny low seam. A same-scale still can establish candidate contrast; moving source/footprint/safe-landing and held ordinary-primary recovery need their own affected portrait evidence.

This file adds only front braced art. Existing rear Alppain and shared recovery candidates do not automatically match this new contour; Alppain forked recovery and any chosen facing mapping remain unfinished. The [owned visual component](../../../scripts/acts/act3/stalker_art.gd) is unchanged by this task. No source phase, tracking cutoff, lock duration, travel, damage, cooldown, vulnerability, hitbox or sun clock follows from the art pose.

The task began against adopted shared-6 at HEAD `63dcf99de1bcfa9bb86c1bde41acd7db31207dc2` in the registered `codex/campaign-act3` checkout, with published shared-7 unadopted and the grounded-sweep request pending. A read-only final revision check observed HEAD `a7bcc4734aa13ef82f7120969336e7108f416c27`, the root-owned merge of `43c8f6d16fb12e2c137610948083101ec9beecff` (grounded source sweep fix), whose history includes shared-7. This asset task neither evaluated that API change nor ran its checks. Earlier source-only portraits are the reason for this art study, not acceptance evidence for the new PNG. No engine/import, test, consumer, four durable-record, mailbox or commit work is part of this asset task.

Before selecting the candidate, root performs the affected actual portrait comparison. Source/cue coexistence, moving feet/pivot, sun-shape teaching and physical recovery acceptance remain pending. There is no human play, balance or timing claim.

## Exact edit prompt

```text
Use case: precise-object-edit.
Asset type: ONE transparent pixel 2.5D game-enemy cutout, Cinder Act 3 Sunbound Stalker C50 / A3-E1, stronger front Alppain braced-crest CANDIDATE.

Input 1, sunbound-stalker-branchspell.png, is the exact EDIT TARGET and the authoritative identity, body, pose, palette, facing, canvas scale and feet-placement reference.
Input 2, sunbound-stalker-alppain.png, is a supporting reference ONLY for the idea of splitting the EXISTING HEAD CREST into a fork. Do not copy Input 2's shortened upper-back contour or other redraw drift.

Primary request: preserve Input 1's whole organism and change ONLY its EXISTING HEAD CREST at the lowered lower-right-facing head into a substantial SHORT BROAD TWO-PRONG FORK. The two prongs must frame one large genuinely transparent open V/U-shaped gap, about 100–125 native pixels wide on the 1254-by-1254 canvas. This gap is the main requested change: it should survive as roughly 6–8 clear pixels when the whole creature is displayed only 50–60 pixels high. Use thick simple flat violet prong shapes with an unmistakable broad open gap, not a tiny notch between microglints. Keep the fork SHORT and broad within the head-crest area, directed with the existing lowered head toward lower-right; no tall antlers. Reshape the SAME existing crest into this fork, rather than adding a horn, organ, antenna, crown or another ridge. Preserve the head itself, jaw silhouette and pale low flank seam.

Strict edit invariants: retain the Branchspell input's body outside the head crest, including the original tall upper-back/dorsal plate contour, plate arrangement, black-purple/violet/lavender organic facets, restrained pale ivory/muted-lime flank join, all FOUR bent limbs, four clawed feet, all limb gaps and the same quiet braced preparation stance. Do not shorten the back, turn the body, move the limbs, enlarge the head, alter body proportions, or shift the organism. Keep the same fixed overhead approximately 45-degree orthographic three-quarter lower-right view and crisp stepped pixel vocabulary.

Canvas/placement: preserve the full 1254-by-1254 transparent canvas, native object scale and placement. Preserve the approximate lowest visible feet baseline at y1051 and central feet pivot around (635,1051). Keep all four feet and the whole organism visible with the same transparent margins. Do not crop, zoom, rotate, rescale or recenter. This family uses the same 1.35/807 world units per native pixel; the art edit must not demand a different scale.

Material/style: broad flat dark and violet pixel color planes with restrained lavender angular highlights, matching Input 1. Keep the fork as a body silhouette rather than a glowing symbol. Do not add sparkly microglints, a glow outline, target gem, bright cue or decoration.

Scene/background: truly transparent alpha only. No floor, contact disk, shadow, scenery, geometry or background.

Constraints: exactly one whole creature and one braced still. No duplicate, atlas, frame strip, opposite-facing or recovery pose, motion trail, beam, laser, projectile, attack footprint, warning lane, arrow, weapon, equipment, pickup, UI, text, labels, watermark or extra organs. This is the same C50/A3-E1 organism and crest configuration, a root-authored contour choice, not novel canon or a new enemy/ability. No hitbox, exclusive weak point, damage, timing or mechanic is encoded. Change only the existing head crest into a clearly larger open short fork; preserve everything else as faithfully as possible.

## Root consumer trial

Root selected this front braced candidate for an owned consumer trial at unchanged offset(-8,424)/1.35/807. The new-resource import `.cinder/stalker-readable-and-primary-fixture-import.log` exited0 without script/resource errors. Actual matching portrait and held-crest teaching remain pending; no readiness promotion.
